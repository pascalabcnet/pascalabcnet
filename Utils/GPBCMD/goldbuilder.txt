Overview 
    The Builder is the main component of the GOLD Parsing System. The main duty 
    of the Builder is to read a source grammar written in the GOLD 
    Meta-Language, produce the LALR and DFA parse tables, and, finally, save 
    this information to Compiled Grammar Table file.  
    
    This program does not create any on-screen text. This allows the program to 
    be easily be called from other applications. To check whether a grammar was 
    successly analyzed, check the content of the generated log file. 
     
Details 
    Options
        -details, +details
            If this flag is set true, the log file will contain details about 
            how the Grammar file was interpreted. This option defaults to 
            true.

        -export, +export
            If this field is specified, the program will export the generated 
            tables to the log. This feature is identical to the Export to
            Formatted Text feature in the Windows version of the Builder. If 
            a critical error is found in the grammar, this feature is 
            automatically activated. This option defaults to false.

    Grammar 
        Required. The grammar file. 
    
    CGT File 
        Optional. If this field is left blank, the goldbuilder program will 
        automatically create a filename using the grammar's filename. The new
        filename will contain the same base, but will have the .cgt extension.
        For example, if the grammar filename is "test.grm", the file 
        "test.cgt" will be created. 
        
    Log File 
        Optional. Like the CGT File field, if left blank, the goldbuilder 
        program will automatically create a file. In this case, the 
        extension will be .log
