  /// This control is intended to be used for toolbar, menu or button icons where ability of an icon to 
  /// grey itself out when disabled is essential.
  /// <remarks>
  /// 1) Greyscale image is created using FormatConvertedBitmap class. Unfortunately when converting the
  ///    image to greyscale this class does n0t preserve transparency information. To overcome that, there is 
  ///    an opacity mask created from original image that is applied to greyscale image in order to preserve
  ///    transparency information. Because of that if an OpacityMask is applied to original image that mask 
  ///    has to be combined with that special opacity mask of greyscale image in order to make a proper 
  ///    greyscale image look. If you know how to combine two opacity masks please let me know.
  /// 2) DrawingImage source is not supported at the moment.
  /// 3) Have not tried to use any BitmapSource derived sources accept for BitmapImage so it may not be 
  ///    able to convert some of them to greyscale.
  /// 4) When specifying source Uri from XAML try to use Absolute Uri otherwise the greyscale image
  ///    may not be created in some scenarious. There is some code to improve the situation but I cannot 
  ///    guarantee it will work in all possible scenarious.
  /// 5) In case the greyscaled version cannot be created for whatever reason the original image with 
  ///    60% opacity (i.e. dull colours) will be used instead (that will work even with the DrawingImage 
  ///    source).
