      <para>Probably the most important feature for any text editor is syntax highlighting.</para>
      <para>AvalonEdit has a flexible text rendering model, see
        <link xlink:href="c06e9832-9ef0-4d65-ac2e-11f7ce9c7774" />. Among the
		text rendering extension points is the support for "visual line transformers" that
		can change the display of a visual line after it has been constructed by the "visual element generators".
		A useful base class implementing IVisualLineTransformer for the purpose of syntax highlighting
		is <codeEntityReference>T:ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit.Rendering.DocumentColorizingTransformer</codeEntityReference>.
		Take a look at that class' documentation to see
		how to write fully custom syntax highlighters. This article only discusses the XML-driven built-in
		highlighting engine.

      <title>The highlighting engine</title>
      <content>
        <para>
			The highlighting engine in AvalonEdit is implemented in the class
			<codeEntityReference>T:ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit.Highlighting.DocumentHighlighter</codeEntityReference>.
			Highlighting is the process of taking a DocumentLine and constructing
			a <codeEntityReference>T:ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit.Highlighting.HighlightedLine</codeEntityReference>
			instance for it by assigning colors to different sections of the line.
			A <codeInline>HighlightedLine</codeInline> is simply a list of
			(possibly nested) highlighted text sections.
		</para><para>
			The <codeInline>HighlightingColorizer</codeInline> class is the only
			link between highlighting and rendering.
			It uses a <codeInline>DocumentHighlighter</codeInline> to implement
			a line transformer that applies the
			highlighting to the visual lines in the rendering process.
		</para><para>
			Except for this single call, syntax highlighting is independent from the
			rendering namespace. To help with other potential uses of the highlighting
			engine, the <codeInline>HighlightedLine</codeInline> class has the
			method <codeInline>ToHtml()</codeInline>
			to produce syntax highlighted HTML source code.
		</para>
        <para>The highlighting rules used by the highlighting engine to highlight
			the document are described by the following classes:
			</para>
			
<definitionTable>
  <definedTerm>HighlightingRuleSet</definedTerm>
  <definition>Describes a set of highlighting spans and rules.</definition>
  <definedTerm>HighlightingSpan</definedTerm>
  <definition>A span consists of two regular expressions (Start and End), a color,
			and a child ruleset.
			The region between Start and End expressions will be assigned the
			given color, and inside that span, the rules of the child
			ruleset apply.
			If the child ruleset also has <codeInline>HighlightingSpan</codeInline>s,
			they can be nested, allowing highlighting constructs like nested comments or one language
			embedded in another.</definition>
  <definedTerm>HighlightingRule</definedTerm>
  <definition>A highlighting rule is a regular expression with a color.
  			It will highlight matches of the regular expression using that color.</definition>
  <definedTerm>HighlightingColor</definedTerm>
  <definition>A highlighting color isn't just a color: it consists of a foreground
			color, font weight and font style.</definition>
</definitionTable>
		<para>
       The highlighting engine works by first analyzing the spans: whenever a
       begin RegEx matches some text, that span is pushed onto a stack.
       Whenever the end RegEx of the current span matches some text,
       the span is popped from the stack.
		</para><para>
		Each span has a nested rule set associated with it, which is empty 
		by default. This is why keywords won't be highlighted inside comments: 
		the span's empty ruleset is active there, so the keyword rule is not applied.
		</para><para>
		This feature is also used in the string span: the nested span will match 
		when a backslash is encountered, and the character following the backslash
		will be consumed by the end RegEx of the nested span 
		(<codeInline>.</codeInline> matches any character). 
		This ensures that <codeInline>\"</codeInline> does not denote the end of the string span;
		but <codeInline>\\"</codeInline> still does.
		</para><para>
		What's great about the highlighting engine is that it highlights only
		on-demand, works incrementally, and yet usually requires only a
		few KB of memory even for large code files.
		</para><para>
		On-demand means that when a document is opened, only the lines initially 
		visible will be highlighted. When the user scrolls down, highlighting will continue
		from the point where it stopped the last time. If the user scrolls quickly,
		so that the first visible line is far below the last highlighted line,
		then the highlighting engine still has to process all the lines in between
		– there might be comment starts in them. However, it will only scan that region
		for changes in the span stack; highlighting rules will not be tested.
		</para><para>
		The stack of active spans is stored at the beginning of every line.
		If the user scrolls back up, the lines getting into view can be highlighted 
		immediately because the necessary context (the span stack) is still available.
		</para><para>
		Incrementally means that even if the document is changed, the stored span stacks
		will be reused as far as possible. If the user types <codeInline>/*</codeInline>,
		that would theoretically cause the whole remainder of the file to become
		highlighted in the comment color.
		However, because the engine works on-demand, it will only update the span
		stacks within the currently visible region and keep a notice 
		'the highlighting state is not consistent between line X and line X+1',
		where X is the last line in the visible region.
		Now, if the user would scroll down,
		the highlighting state would be updated and the 'not consistent' notice
		would be moved down. But usually, the user will continue typing
		and type <codeInline>*/</codeInline> only a few lines later.
		Now the highlighting state in the visible region will revert to the normal
		'only the main ruleset is on the stack of active spans'. 
		When the user now scrolls down below the line with the 'not consistent' marker;
		the engine will notice that the old stack and the new stack are identical;
		and will remove the 'not consistent' marker. 
		This allows reusing the stored span stacks cached from before the user typed
		<codeInline>/*</codeInline>.
		</para><para>
		While the stack of active spans might change frequently inside the lines,
		it rarely changes from the beginning of one line to the beginning of the next line.
		With most languages, such changes happen only at the start and end of multiline comments.
		The highlighting engine exploits this property by storing the list of
		span stacks in a special data structure
		(<codeEntityReference>T:ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit.Utils.CompressingTreeList`1</codeEntityReference>).
		The memory usage of the highlighting engine is linear to the number of span stack changes;
		not to the total number of lines.
		This allows the highlighting engine to store the span stacks for big code
		files using only a tiny amount of memory, especially in languages like
		C# where sequences of <codeInline>//</codeInline> or <codeInline>///</codeInline>
		are more popular than <codeInline>/* */</codeInline> comments.

      <title>XML highlighting definitions</title>
      <content>
        <para>AvalonEdit supports XML syntax highlighting definitions (.xshd files).</para>
        <para>In the AvalonEdit source code, you can find the file
        <codeInline>ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit\Highlighting\Resources\ModeV2.xsd</codeInline>.
        This is an XML schema for the .xshd file format; you can use it to
        code completion for .xshd files in XML editors.
        </para>
        <para>Here is an example highlighting definition for a sub-set of C#:
<code language="xml"><![CDATA[
<SyntaxDefinition name="C#"
        xmlns="http://icsharpcode.net/sharpdevelop/syntaxdefinition/2008">
    <Color name="Comment" foreground="Green" />
    <Color name="String" foreground="Blue" />
    
    <!-- This is the main ruleset. -->
    <RuleSet>
        <Span color="Comment" begin="//" />
        <Span color="Comment" multiline="true" begin="/\*" end="\*/" />
        
        <Span color="String">
            <Begin>"</Begin>
            <End>"</End>
            <RuleSet>
                <!-- nested span for escape sequences -->
                <Span begin="\\" end="." />
            </RuleSet>
        </Span>
        
        <Keywords fontWeight="bold" foreground="Blue">
            <Word>if</Word>
            <Word>else</Word>
            <!-- ... -->
        </Keywords>
        
        <!-- Digits -->
        <Rule foreground="DarkBlue">
            \b0[xX][0-9a-fA-F]+  # hex number
        |    \b
            (    \d+(\.[0-9]+)?   #number with optional floating point
            |    \.[0-9]+         #or just starting with floating point
            )
            ([eE][+-]?[0-9]+)? # optional exponent

      <title>ICSharpCode.TextEditor XML highlighting definitions</title>
      <content>
        <para>ICSharpCode.TextEditor (the predecessor of AvalonEdit) used
        a different version of the XSHD file format.
        AvalonEdit detects the difference between the formats using the XML namespace:
        The new format uses <codeInline>xmlns="http://icsharpcode.net/sharpdevelop/syntaxdefinition/2008"</codeInline>,
        the old format does not use any XML namespace.
        </para><para>
        AvalonEdit can load .xshd files written in that old format, and even
        automatically convert them to the new format. However, not all
        constructs of the old file format are supported by AvalonEdit.
        </para>
        <code language="cs"><![CDATA[// convert from old .xshd format to new format
XshdSyntaxDefinition xshd;
using (XmlTextReader reader = new XmlTextReader("input.xshd")) {
    xshd = HighlightingLoader.LoadXshd(reader);
}
using (XmlTextWriter writer = new XmlTextWriter("output.xshd", System.Text.Encoding.UTF8)) {
    writer.Formatting = Formatting.Indented;
    new SaveXshdVisitor(writer).WriteDefinition(xshd);

      <title>Programmatically accessing highlighting information</title>
      <content>
        <para>As described above, the highlighting engine only stores the "span stack"
        at the start of each line. This information can be retrieved using the
        <codeEntityReference>M:ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit.Highlighting.DocumentHighlighter.GetSpanStack(System.Int32)</codeEntityReference>
        method:
<code language="cs"><![CDATA[bool isInComment = documentHighlighter.GetSpanStack(1).Any(
    s => s.SpanColor != null && s.SpanColor.Name == "Comment");
// returns true if the end of line 1 (=start of line 2) is inside a multiline comment]]></code>
		Spans can be identified using their color. For this purpose, named colors should be used in the syntax definition.
        </para>
        <para>For more detailed results inside lines, the highlighting algorithm
        must be executed for that line:
<code language="cs"><![CDATA[int off = document.GetOffset(7, 22);
HighlightedLine result = documentHighlighter.HighlightLine(document.GetLineByNumber(7));
bool isInComment = result.Sections.Any(
    s => s.Offset <= off && s.Offset+s.Length >= off
         && s.Color.Name == "Comment");]]></code>
